# Prompt Engineering Documentation

This document outlines the prompts and approach used to create the Business Contact Form application using spec-driven development with Kiro.

## Initial Prompt

The project began with this concise prompt:

```
create spec-driven development nodejs react micro app for business contact web form hosted on AWS as inexpensive as possible the domain name is "thunk-it.com" registered with AWS route53
```

This prompt was intentionally brief but contained several key elements:
- The development approach: spec-driven development
- Technologies: Node.js and React
- Application type: business contact web form
- Hosting: AWS with cost optimization
- Domain information: "thunk-it.com" registered with Route53

## Spec-Driven Development Process

The development followed a structured spec-driven approach:

### 1. Requirements Gathering

The initial prompt was transformed into a comprehensive requirements document with:
- User stories in the format "As a [role], I want [feature], so that [benefit]"
- Acceptance criteria using EARS format (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax)
- Clear organization into functional areas

Key requirements areas included:
- Contact form interface
- Form submission processing
- AWS infrastructure
- Administration capabilities
- Performance and reliability

### 2. Design Phase

The requirements were then transformed into a detailed design document covering:
- Architecture (serverless approach for cost optimization)
- Components and interfaces
- Data models
- Error handling
- Testing strategy
- Cost optimization
- Infrastructure as code approach

During this phase, cost considerations led to selecting AWS SAM as the most cost-effective infrastructure approach.

### 3. Implementation Planning

The design was broken down into specific, actionable tasks:
- Project infrastructure setup
- Frontend component implementation
- Backend service implementation
- Admin functionality
- Monitoring and error handling
- Testing and optimization
- Deployment and documentation

Each task was linked back to specific requirements to ensure traceability.

### 4. Implementation

The implementation followed the task list, creating:
- AWS SAM template for infrastructure
- Lambda functions for backend processing
- React components for the frontend
- Local development environment for testing

## Effective Prompting Techniques Used

### 1. Clear Objective Statement

The initial prompt clearly stated what needed to be built, which technologies to use, and key constraints (cost optimization).

### 2. Iterative Refinement

Follow-up prompts focused on specific aspects:
- "Is it possible to use terraform instead of the CDK"
- "Please choose the most cost effective solution"
- "Can I test and review this locally on my Macintosh OSX 15.5 before deploying"

These iterative refinements helped shape the solution to better meet specific needs.

### 3. Specific Technical Requirements

Including specific technical details in prompts:
- Mentioning AWS account ID and profile: "let's deploy this to my AWS account '00000000000' and profile 'devops'"
- Specifying operating system version: "Macintosh OSX 15.5"

### 4. Asking for Documentation

The request for "complete documentation" and this prompt engineering documentation demonstrates the importance of documenting both the solution and the process.

## Lessons for Effective Prompting

1. **Start with a clear, concise objective** that includes key technologies and constraints
2. **Iterate with specific questions** rather than trying to get everything perfect in one prompt
3. **Provide technical context** when relevant to get more accurate and useful responses
4. **Request documentation** both for the solution and for learning purposes
5. **Use a structured development approach** like spec-driven development to ensure comprehensive coverage

## Example Prompt Templates

### Project Initialization

```
create spec-driven development [technology stack] app for [specific purpose] hosted on [platform] as [constraints] [additional context]
```

### Technology Selection

```
is it possible to use [alternative technology] instead of [proposed technology]
```

### Cost Optimization

```
please choose the most cost effective solution for [specific aspect]
```

### Local Testing

```
can I test and review this locally on [operating system and version] before deploying
```

### Documentation Request

```
can you include a separate readme for [specific purpose]
```

## Conclusion

The spec-driven development approach combined with clear, iterative prompting resulted in a comprehensive solution that:
- Meets all stated requirements
- Optimizes for cost
- Provides local testing capabilities
- Includes thorough documentation

This demonstrates how effective prompt engineering can guide AI assistants to produce high-quality, practical software solutions.
